# README #

The final version of the application.
The user enters the dimension of the matrix in the input field. 
You can specify the speed of the appearance of cells in the address bar by adding a hash
that looks like "animationspeed = 1000". Instead of the animation speed, you can enter 
any other string. The main thing is that the line contains the equal sign and the number 
after it. 
After entering a new value, you need to press the button "Enter".
After entering the dimension, the matrix is gradually filled with values. 
Each individual value is represented by a square. 
The matrix is filled counter-clockwise in a spiral.
