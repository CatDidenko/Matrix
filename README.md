# README #

Test application version. 
In the application, there is no dynamic addition of the dimension of the matrix. 
The dimension of the matrix is given by a variable.
In the near future, I will do a code refactoring, add styles and a form for user input.

### What is this repository for? ###

The application generates a matrix. The size of the matrix is set by the user. 
The application fills the matrix with numbers that do not contain the number six.

### How do I get set up? ###

Clone the repository or download the archive.
Run the file "testtask1.html".
